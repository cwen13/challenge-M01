# challenge-M01 Refactoring Code
First challenge for code camp

## Goal

Given code for a webpage we were to refactor the code to be more semantic. This
includeed adjusting tag names in the HTML and CSS files as well as adding alt 
text. Then in the CSS file the selectors where declarations where condensed and 
the order of selectors from element to class.

## What does this solve?

This was to help create a more accessable website and explicit code for parsing.

## What was learned?

In this I learned how to differnetiate beween class or element selectors and the
interchangeablity of them when updated together.


## Screen shots

The follwing is how the top and bottom sections of the site look when rendered.
